# MINTING-NFT

This contract offers fundamental functionality for token creation, token administration and balance tracking.
"PUSH" is the token name or tokenName. The token abbreviation ( tokenAbbrv ) for "PULL" is "PULL"
Total supply:  Total supply (totalSupply) is said to zero at the beginning.

Balances mapping :  the contract maintains a mapping name balances that keeps track of the token balances at various addresses.
Token minting: the "mint" function enables the creation of new tokens and allocates them to given address the supply is increased over all and the balance address is updated.
Burning tokens : The function "burn" enables the destruction of exiting tokens held by a specific address. It reduces the total supply and updates the balance of the address, but only if the address has sufficient tokens.

## Description

The "MyToken" contract is a simple way to construct a token on the etherium blockchain. It enables the generation (minting) and destruction (burning) of tokens by modifying the total supply and individual balances. It provides the basic structure for building token related functionality on ethereum.
